Mr. Jack is trying to create a Set to store strings. However, he’s not really sure if he has got it right. He wants you to tell him if he’s doing it correctly.

This is the arrangement: he will take all the strings from his set and give them to you in a String array. Accordingly, you have to say true if the strings form a Set and false if they don’t.

Write a static method Met that accepts as parameter a 1D String array and returns true or false as per the above condition.

Write only the method, the main class has already been written.

==========================================================

public static boolean Met(String a[]){
int k=a.length,x=0;
for(int i=0;i<k;i++){
for(int j=i+1;j<k;j++){
if(a[i].equals(a[j]))
x++;
}
}
if(x>0)
return false;
else 
return true;
}
