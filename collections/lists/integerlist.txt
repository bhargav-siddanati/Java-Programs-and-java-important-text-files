Write a class called Solution that has a LinkedList of Integer type called myList. Your Solution should have the following methods:

insert() - accepts as parameter a Integer and inserts it at the end of myList. Doesn’t return anything.
delete() - accepts as parameter a Integer and removes it from myList. Doesn’t return anything.
size() - returns an integer which tells us the size of mylist
print() - prints the elements of myList in a single line. Doesn’t return anything.
Write only the Solution class. The main class has been written.

=========================================================

import java.util.LinkedList;
class Solution{
LinkedList<Integer> myList=new LinkedList<Integer>();

public void insert(int my)
{
myList.add(my);
}

public void delete(int my)
{
myList.remove(myList.indexOf(my));
}

public int size()
{
return (myList.size());
}

public void print()
{
for(int my:myList){
System.out.print(my+" ");
}
System.out.println();
}

}
