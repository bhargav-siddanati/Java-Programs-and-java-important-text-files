You are in-charge of designing the Adventure Land game.

You have to write 2 classes: the Player class and the Leaderboard class

Player has the following data:

a private String for name
a private integer for speed
a private integer for health
Also, it has a parameterized constructor for name, speed and health (name is first parameter, speed is second and health is third)

Leaderboard has the following:
Data

a LinkedList of Player objects called myList
Methods

insert: accepts a player object and inserts it into myList
print: prints the list of Player objects in increasing order of their health (check example)
Write only the Player and Leaderboard class. The Main class has already been written.

Example Input:
sora 100 500
mickey 50 3000
jolly 75 5500
goofy 55 700
minnie 150 5000
Output:
sora, 100, 500
goofy, 55, 700
mickey, 50, 3000
minnie, 150, 5000
jolly, 75, 5500
