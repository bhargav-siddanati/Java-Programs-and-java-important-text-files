What is Scanner?
We have earlier used Scanner to take inputs from the console. However, now that we have seen so many new ways of taking input, where does Scanner fit?

Scanner is not a stream. It’s mainly used with a stream to better break down the inputs into different components.

In the previous examples, we have seen how we used the readLine method to read lines from the connected streams. Our readers are limited in this sense - what if we want to take only the integer and then the string, but not the entire line? or if we had some other way of breaking up the inputs?

This is when we use Scanner.

We have already seen how to use Scanner with the simple System.in stream. This is how we would we use it with the BufferedReader:

Scanner s = null;
s = new Scanner(new BufferedReader(new FileReader("C:\\Users\\Edyst\\Desktop\\com\\company\\poem.txt")));
And then, we may use the different methods of the Scanner class to read from this file.

Method	Description
next()	it returns the next token from the scanner as a String type.
nextLine()	it moves the scanner position to the next line and returns the value as a string.
nextByte()	it scans the next token and returns a byte
nextShort()	it scans the next token and returns a short value
nextInt()	it scans the next token and returns an integer value
nextLong()	it scans the next token and returns a long value
nextFloat()	it scans the next token and returns a float value
nextDouble()	it scans the next token and returns a double value
