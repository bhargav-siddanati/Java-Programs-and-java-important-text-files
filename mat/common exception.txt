You don’t need to memorise all of them! With ample practice, you will get familiar with most of them.

Also, a commonly used method method of the Exception class is the printStackTrace() method.

This method prints the entire stack trace of the exception, allowing us to understnd which circumstances the exception occurred in. It is quite useful when debugging.
