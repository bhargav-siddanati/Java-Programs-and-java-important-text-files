Using the same Game class as the previous question, we will add some movement to our player.

In addition to everything in the previous question, you need to also define the following methods:

moveUp - it moves the player up by one position, by updating the pos_row & pos_col and also redrawing the board. Does not print or return anything
moveDown - it moves the player down by one position, by updating the pos_row & pos_col and also redrawing the board. Does not print or return anything
moveLeft - it moves the player left by one position, by updating the pos_row & pos_col and also redrawing the board. Does not print or return anything
moveRight - it moves the player right by one position, by updating the pos_row & pos_col and also redrawing the board. Does not print or return anything
If any of the moves are not possible, it does not do anything.

Only write the Game class, assume the Main class has already been written.

Example Input:
3 2 2
moveUp()
moveUp()
moveLeft()
Output:
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 1

0 0 0
0 0 1
0 0 0

0 0 1
0 0 0
0 0 0

0 1 0
0 0 0
0 0 0

=========================================================================

class Game{
int pos_row;
int pos_col;
int[][] board;
Game(int a,int b,int c){
board=new int[a][a];
this.pos_row=b;
this.pos_col=c;
}

public void moveUp(){
if(pos_row>0)
pos_row--;
}
public void moveDown(){
if(pos_row<board.length-1)
pos_row++;
}
public void moveLeft(){
if(pos_col>0)
pos_col--;
}
public void moveRight(){
if(pos_col<board.length-1)
pos_col++;
}

public void draw(){
for(int i=0;i<board.length;i++){
for(int j=0;j<board[0].length;j++){
if(i==pos_row&&j==pos_col){
System.out.print(1+" ");}
else
System.out.print(0+" ");
}System.out.println();
}
}

}
