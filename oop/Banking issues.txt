You are given a class called Bank:

class Bank{
    int totalBalance;
    int totalCustomers;
    String data;
}
You have to write 3 classes that inherit from Bank: RBI, WorldBank, UniversalBank. Each of these classes should have a withdrawal method.

RBI
Class name: RBI
Maximum Withdrawal: 100000
withdrawal method: should accept as parameter an integer and deducts it from the totalBalance. Should follow the conditions:

Withdrawal amount has to be multiple of 500. If not, print Invalid and don’t deduct the amount
Withdrawal amount has to be less than the Maximum withdrawal amount. If not, print Invalid and don’t deduct the amount
Otherwise, print the new balance and deduct the amount from totalBalance
WorldBank
Class name: WorldBank
Maximum Withdrawal: 1000000
withdrawal method: should accept as parameter an integer and deducts it from the totalBalance. Should follow the conditions:

Withdrawal amount has to be multiple of 1500. If not, print Invalid and don’t deduct the amount
Withdrawal amount has to be less than or equal to the Maximum withdrawal amount. If not, print Invalid and don’t deduct the amount
Otherwise, print the new balance and deduct the amount from totalBalance
UniversalBank
Class name: UniversalBank
Maximum Withdrawal: 50000
withdrawal method: should accept as parameter an integer and deducts it from the totalBalance. Should follow the conditions:

Withdrawal amount has to be multiple of 250 and above 10000. If not, print Invalid and don’t deduct the amount
Withdrawal amount has to be less than or equal to the Maximum withdrawal amount. If not, print Invalid and don’t deduct the amount
Otherwise, print the new balance and deduct the amount from totalBalance
Tha Bank and Main class have already been written. You have to write the other classes. Use the System.out.println() statement to print.

===========================================================================

class RBI extends Bank{
int max=100000;
public void withdrawal(int a){
if(a%500==0){
if(a<max){
totalBalance-=a;}
System.out.println(totalBalance);}
else
System.out.println("Invalid");
}}

class WorldBank extends Bank{
int max=1000000;
public void withdrawal(int a){
if(a%1500==0){
if(a<=max){
totalBalance-=a;}
System.out.println(totalBalance);}
else
System.out.println("Invalid");
}}

class UniversalBank extends Bank{
int max=50000;
public void withdrawal(int a){
if(a%250==0&&a>10000){
if(a<max){
totalBalance-=a;}
System.out.println(totalBalance);}
else
System.out.println("Invalid");
}
}
