There are certain World Tax Standards and we have written a class for it:

class WorldTax{
    public double salesTax(int amount){
        ...
    }

    public double propertyTax(int amount){
        ...
    }

    public double incomeTax(int amount){
        ...
    }
}
Each of the above methods takes as parameter an integer (amount) and returns the tax applicable on that amount.

However, certain countries have their own standards

.	Sales Tax	Property Tax	Income Tax
India	18%	20 %	Same as World
China	10%	Same as World	Same as World
Japan	5%	5%	5%
Canada	25%	Same as World	25%
As per the information, write the following classes: IndiaTax, ChinaTax, JapanTax, CanadaTax such that they inherit from WorldTax. The methods should return the applicable tax.

The WorldTax and Main class have been defined. You have to define the other classes.

==========================================================================

class IndiaTax extends WorldTax{
    public double salesTax(int amount){
        return 0.18*amount;
    }

    public double propertyTax(int amount){
        return 0.2*amount;
    }

   
}
class ChinaTax extends WorldTax{
    public double salesTax(int amount){
        return 0.1*amount;
    }

    }
class JapanTax extends WorldTax{
    public double salesTax(int amount){
        return 0.05*amount;
    }

    public double propertyTax(int amount){
        return 0.05*amount;
    }

    public double incomeTax(int amount){
        return 0.05*amount;
    }
}
class CanadaTax extends WorldTax{
    public double salesTax(int amount){
        return 0.25*amount;
    }

    

    public double incomeTax(int amount){
        return 0.25*amount;
    }
}
